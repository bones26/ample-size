# Problem, Definition & Solution

## Problem
There is a need for an online marketplace like eBay that is solely dedicated to the plus size clothing market.

### Background
#### ‘Standard Size’ is a myth
Australia does not have an official sizing system for women’s clothing. In 2008, The Australian Standard Coding Scheme for womens clothing was scrapped, allowing retailers to develop their own sizing scale based on sales data and designer preference alone. 

For the mass production of clothing, designers and manufacturers use what is known as a *block* - basically a one-size-fits-all template from which an entire range of sizes is cut. The fit of each garment gets less accurate as it moves further from the original size.

* In Australia today, around 80% of women wear a **size 14.**
* The blocks being used by manufacturers are a **sample size 8-10.**
* The *Plus Size* category generally begins at **size 16.**

#### “Plus size a definite minus”
There exists a HUGE DISCONNECT between the sizes being made for women and the sizes women actually require. Women whose bodies are larger than ‘standard’ are deemed *Plus Size*

As any plus-size female can attest to, finding clothes that achieve the trifecta of on trend, well-fitted *and* affordable is notoriously difficult. This is the case both irl and online.

#### A Bit of Insight

**[A plus size woman walks in to a shop…]**
In department stores, plus size clothing is actually separated into it’s own section, away from the ‘normal’ sizes. The higher end department stores will stock a few specific plus sized brands, like Myer’s *Taking Shape* and David Jones *TS.*and can be spotted a mile off by the blind due to their ‘loud and proud’ colour schemes and opulence of beads and all round…drapiness. These ranges generally consist of garish, shapeless smocks or tunics designed to be worn over trousers or tights. Necklines start at the collarbone and go up, dresses start at the knee and go down. If you happen to make it as far as the change-room with what looks like an arm load of your nanna’s drapes, a well-meaning sales assistant will almost always appear with an additional kimono/sleeveless-knee-length-vest/pashmina-cape-throw for you to “give it a try”.  The rule of thumb is -  Cover Everything. Layer over your layers. Add bright, sparkly beads to show other people you are indeed capable of joy.

If this isn’t humiliating and dehumanising enough, more affordable department stores try to mimic the set up of their Myer-like counterparts but in a decidedly more “hide-them” way. The plus size section is relegated to the back or far corner and, being a specifically designed-for-store range, a cringeworthy name like ‘Belle Curve’ (Target) is emblazoned high on the walls. While the Cover-Everything rule still applies, the range is decidedly smaller and the colours more ’reserved’ than it’s flashy cousin, tending towards blacks, greys and muted pinks or blues. There’s a lot of denim, mostly the ‘jegging’ variety and no end of flower prints. ‘Basics’ means something different in plus-size. The search for a plain black t-shirt or singlet will return a plain black t-shirt with a tacked on shoulder cape and batwing sleeves, and a singlet with a loner panel of fabric draped down the front. And possibly a big frilly flower. Again, I assume, so we remember to feel joy and so normal people know that they can approach us a without being eaten. 

**[A plus size woman [logs in] to a shop…]**
Online stores have definitely been the driving force behind trends finally becoming available to the plus size population. At present, there’s even a few places like ASOS Curve and ModCloth doing it right - they have actual plus size models. Not just the scaled-up hourglass model, but models with tummy’s, big chests and flat butts, flat chests and big butts, tall big, short big.  

For the first time, it’s possible for a plus sized woman to read the “Our model is 168cm tall with a size C bust and is wearing a size 18 in this item” and be able to judge if the fit is right without needing a tape-measure. 

Even better - stores like ASOS, Modcloth and The Iconic are actually using a larger fit model to size their ranges. This means the clothes we want to wear are actually being designed to fit our body, which is something new and wonderful.

## Why is there a need for selling and buying plus-sized clothing?
##### Fact 1: 
Despite the average size being a 14, designers are still only creating for size 8-10. 

##### Fact 2: 
While the industry is slowly changing, there is not currently a lot of places where you can just ‘grab something’ without spending a lot of money 

##### Fact 3:
Australia is particularly lacking in plus sized providers so plus size women are required to shop on US sites, which come with large postage fees.

##### Fact 4:
The plus size sections of eBay and Gumtree are similar to real life - lacking, badly made or fugly.  No search paramaters or specific filtering options exist for navigation within this area. 

##### Fact 5:
The retail experience of the plus sized shopper is drastically different to it’s standard counterpart. From shop design and clothing location to price & availability, the plus sized shopper is treated as a second class citizen. This is true for the online market-place experience for plus size as well. The “Womens Clothing”sections of marketplaces like Gumtree and eBay don’t currently cater to the plus-sized category in the same way that they do to the more traditional sizes. 

##### Therefore 
While we wait for the fashion industry to get to a stage where plus size is just one more size in a wide and varied range, Aussie women would benefit from an eBay type of platform catering exclusively to Plus Size. 

## Why online?
While more online retailers are recognising that catering to plus size is a viable financial move, this market is still mostly untapped and under-represented in two-sided marketplace environments like eBay and Gumtree. Currently, a search for “plus size” or “XXL” on eBay returns items in size 8, that go *up* to size 22. As is the case for real life retailers, the ‘sample size’ block is still being used in the majority of cases so items that have been cut for a size 22, or even size 16 vary greatly and are ill-fitting at best. In addition to this, products marked as XXL - XXXXL in China are much smaller in make than their online measurements indicate. 

When purchasing from an eBay-like platform, it’s the items that are being sold by Australian plus-size women that match accurately with what a plus size shopper requires. These items usually bare the description “only worn once” or “bought from US but didn’t fit and don’t want to pay the return postage”. In the case of the items being described as “Used”, the reason for sale is frequently due to the clothes no longer fitting because the users body shape has changed. 

An online two-sided marketplace dedicated entirely to plus size would provide a solution to the most commonly experienced problems of plus size shoppers, with the added benefit that all sizing would be described by their sellers in relation to their personal body shape and ‘size’.

## Why within Australia?
While we wait for the fashion industry to grow up (and out), the most promising places to shop are online. These sites are generally expensive and due to a large contingency of plus size websites being based in America, attract exorbitant postage fees.

A plus-size two-sided marketplace would offer an alternative to paying return postage if an item doesn’t fit and if the item is brand new, most users would still be happy to pay the cost price since they would save on postage fees. 

A discussion of the label sizes and actual fit between users would translate the varied range of ‘standard’ into usable terms specific to the plus sized client.

## What's wrong with the sites that already exist?
Sites like The Iconic, Modcloth and ASOS Curve boast a superior user experience for the plus sized shopper. However, there’s still a ways to go before the plus sized retail experience mirrors that of the ‘standard’ size. 
 
##### User Experience
The Iconic for example, could be improved in a number of areas:

* Unless you navigate specifically to the plus size section, the results will often return items shown on standard models (Ahhhhh! I’’ve stumbled in to the thin dimension)
* Plus Size is treated as a type of style on many sites. On the homepage, it’s the ‘normal’ sizes you are met with when you click on Womens Clothing. Both should be represented..
* The option ‘Plus Size’ is categorised in the clothing types: 
‘Dresses’ 
‘Shorts’ 
‘Plus Size’
‘Shoes’ 
In other sites where this is the case, the user doesn’t have the same filtering functionality - once you’ve navigated to the plus size clothing type, to view the plus size dresses you must view all the plus sized items.
* Reduce or eliminate fat-targeted ads - weightloss/diet/surgery (because don’t be a douchebag google!)
* Make it exclusively Australian, so that users know that the sizes and descriptions (“would fit a large 14”) are specific to them
* Add database tables for adding item specifics (body-shape like (multiple options), bra_size, measurements, height etc  to increase accuracy of listings as well as increase ease of use for sellers 

## Solution
Create a targeted online marketplace with features specifically dedicated to the buying and selling experience of plus-sized clothing within Australia.
